## Helping Students Manage Their Time more Productively
### Jasmine Mai, Michelle Yu
### CS65 Final Project

## Overview
For this final project, we created an app targeted towards students that helped students manage their time more efficiently. From experience, we know that many students only put in their mandatory meetings and classes in their digital calendars, leaving the spaces in between blank. Our app strives to take in information about what the user needs to acheive and basically fills in these blanks for them, so that they have a set plan about how their day will go.

## UI Overview and Stories:
The user is first taken to a welcome screen, and can click on a button to go to the main part of the app. Here, they are greeted with a tabbed layout and a floating button.
